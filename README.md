# Nathan's Movie Trailer Project

This project is a gallery of a few of my favorite movies, with film 
posters that show trailers of the films when they are clicked.

## Instructions

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the files into a single folder,
open your Python Shell. Then, click File, Open, and navigate to the
unzipped folder, and select the file "entertainment_center.py." Once
open, press F5 to run the file view the website.

## License

This project is part of the **Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree** program. Though
I did the work to complete the project, a lot of it was given to me as 
a template. If you'd like to use it, I'd refer you to the **Udacity** folks
to get permission. Better yet, take the Nanodegree, and you'll get to 
do the project yourself!
